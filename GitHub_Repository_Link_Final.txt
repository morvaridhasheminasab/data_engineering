This repository contains the final implementation of a batch-processing data architecture project.
The solution is fully containerized using Docker and includes microservices for data ingestion,
preprocessing, storage, and delivery. The architecture can be executed on any machine that supports
Docker and Docker Compose, ensuring portability and reproducibility of the data pipeline.
